### Project Description:

This project will prototype a mobile-first fullstack progressive web application (PWA) for offline fisheries data collection, including font- and back-end and database. The lessons learned from this effort will inform the DIS Development Team of the pros and cons of PWA development as an alternative to native mobile applications development for offline data collection.

This application, named _AtlasDataEntry_, will allow the user to sign into the application. create or modify a fishing trip, and record basic catch and effort data. See requirements and mockups below.
